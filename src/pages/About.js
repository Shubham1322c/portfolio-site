    <p>
      i am a self-taught front-end developer based in india. My interest started
      growing in web development in early 2021. Back then i used to watch my
      brother create cool and interactive websites in my free time. It was kind
      of fascinating to me. And to get the answers of my questions(like how the
      web works ?, how browser can understand the code we write, how can i
      create my own websites ? and what not) I finally started my journey in
      august of 2021. Starting from no-code in january 2021 i became obsessed
      with the world of programming. Since then, i have done quite a lot,
      including teaching myself web development and it's best practices,
      building several fun and exciting projects and finding best and easy to
      understand solutions. I have always liked the idea of creating and
      learning instead of just learning. I like teaching myself new skills,
      technologies and also improving the skills that i already know. Besides
      coding, i enjoy reading, spending time with family and friends and having
      deep conversation with my brother about some technology.
